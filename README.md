# RPM Specfiles

The motivation for this project is that as the paradigma changes from
*server-oriented* to *cloud-oriented* many software is lacking specfiles
for major *GNU/Linux* distributions' packaging systems.  Therefor for my
personal needs I started to package software I use on my own.

RPMs produced by specfiles from this repository not only are **not
guaranteed** to even build but also  may not do what you would expect
them to!  Review them carefully before you try to build them and use
them in your RHEL-based distribution. **YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!** Any
suggestion or PR are on the other hand encouraged. Enjoy!
